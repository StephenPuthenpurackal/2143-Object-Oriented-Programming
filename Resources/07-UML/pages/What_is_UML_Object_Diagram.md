Before we learn Object Diagram, let's understand-

## <span id="1"></span>What is a Class Diagram?

A class represents things that are put together having common behavior.
It is a blueprint of an object-oriented system

Let us consider an exciting example of classes and objects. We all know
cars like Ferrari, Volkswagen, Mercedes, and Porsche, etc. These are all
cars manufacturing companies. Here, we can consider that a car **** is a
**class** and Ferrari, Mercedes are the **objects**

## <span id="2"></span>What is an Object Diagram?

Objects are the real-world entities whose behavior is defined by the
classes. Objects are used to represent the static view of an
object-oriented system. We cannot define an object without its class.
Object and class diagrams are somewhat similar.

The difference between the class and object diagram is that the class
diagram mainly represents the bird's eye view of a system which is also
referred to as an abstract view. An object diagram describes the
instance of a class. It visualizes the particular functionality of a
system.

## <span id="3"></span>How to draw an object diagram?

1.  Before drawing an object diagram, one should analyze all the objects
    inside the system.
2.  The relations of the object must be known before creating the
    diagram.
3.  Association between various objects must be cleared before.
4.  An object should have a meaningful name that describes its
    functionality.
5.  An object must be explored to analyze various functionalities of it.

## <span id="4"></span>Purpose of an object diagram:

1.  It is used to describe the static aspect of a system.
2.  It is used to represent an instance of a class.
3.  It can be used to perform forward and reverse engineering on
    systems.
4.  It is used to understand the behavior of an object.
5.  It can be used to explore the relations of an object and can be used
    to analyze other connecting objects.

### Object diagram example:

![Object Diagram](./images/612fbeacaed742eb2695f5996585f399341421f5.png)

The above UML object diagram contains two objects named Ferrari and BMW
which belong to a class named as a Car. The objects are nothing but
real-world entities that are the instances of a class.

## <span id="5"></span>Applications of Object Diagrams:

1.  Object diagrams play an essential role while generating a blueprint
    of an object-oriented system.
2.  Object diagrams provide means of modeling the classes, data and
    other information as a set or a single unit.
3.  It is used for analyzing the online or offline system. The
    functioning of a system can be visualized using object diagrams.

| **Serial no.** | **Class**                                                   | **Object**                                              |
| **1**          | It represents static aspects of a system.                   | It represents the behavior of a system in real time.    |
| **2**          | It doesn't include dynamic changes.                         | It captures runtime changes of a system.                |
| **3**          | It never includes attributes or data values of an instance. | It includes attributes and data values of any instance. |
| **4**          | Class diagram manipulates the behavior of objects.          | Objects are instances of classes.                       |

## Summary

1.  Class groups together things that share similar behavior.
2.  A class represents a bird's eye view of a system, i.e., an
    abstraction which is an object-oriented programming concept.
3.  An object represents a static view of an object-oriented system.
4.  One class can refer to multiple classes.
5.  A single class can have any number of objects.
6.  Objects are related to one another because they share the same
    class.
7.  The object of different classes can also be connected.
